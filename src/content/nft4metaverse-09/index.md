This is an original video released by Cthuwork who has 700,000 fans on Bilibili (China version of Youtube) on April 3 last year. Cthuwork reproduces the natural scenery and prosperity of Bianliang, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty and the banks of Bianhe River outlined by the painter Zhang Zeduan in three dimensions through the art of voxel, which has received 7.229 million views and 41,000 pop-up comments on Bilibili by far. Cthuwork was established in 2012 and has been popular for building traditional Chinese architecture in the virtual world of Minecraft.

It is said that Cthuwork will launch the voxel version of Qingming Shanghe Tu NFT on June 24. 20,000 limited edition digital blind boxes will be made with dramatic and distinctive characters from the long scroll of Qingming Shanghe Tu, and these blind boxes will be distributed based on the BSC chain. After the blind boxes are sold, the Cthuwork team will start the construction of the metaverse of "Qingming Shanghe Tu".

In January this year, Metaverse Capital, which focuses on Metaverse investments, entered into a partnership with Cthuwork. Today, NFT4Metaverse invited Alen, a partner of Metaverse Capital, to write an exclusive article to reveal his insights and investment logic of NFT and Metaverse.

> I learned about Decentraland and liked its concept in 2017 because I still had imagination as a senior gamer. But it was not very mature at that time, so I didn't participate much. The opportunity was the boom of NBA Top Shot at the end of last year, which includes culture (sports) + finance, so we saw the possibility that NFT could embrace mass adoption quickly with the form of money-making effect.
>
> We soon realized that this would bring two very big changes.
>
> 1. NFT is a carrier that can quickly combine the information it carries with finance, and as a result, the content and creativity that was once very popular but not so financially successful will be activated in large numbers. The activation of a large number of individuals will lead to new forms of collaboration.
>
> 1. The accelerated arrival of the Metaverse or virtual space is essentially a resonance of macroeconomics, monetary policy, technology, talent, and capital catalyzed by the global epidemic. It is a brand new market, meaning that there are a large number of uncultivated and undefined markets, and the early explorers will gain the right to speak, define the rules, and receive a large amount of dividends.
>
> With such a big change, it would be a pity not to fight for the right to speak sooner. The above was only a hazy feeling at the time, but the feeling behind this with the odds thinking is already enough to make us act. What ensued was the kind of project that wanted to get involved.
>
> Let's think about this from the source of NFT, the underlying cornerstone of the Metaverse.
>
> **NFT contains Information + Finance + Programmable + Blockchain**
>
> - Blockchain, which means the ability to persist and make a lasting impact
> - Information means culture and communication. Pleasant content is always more resonant to the public, gaining more consensus, bringing social possibilities and greater vitality.
> - Finance combines with Crypto can lead to innovative models
> - Programmable means that more ways to play can be iterated continuously.
>
> It's natural to think that investing in Metaverse's architectural productivity is a great direction:
>
> 1. short-term scarcity, most people like to be Li Ka-Shing speculating on land and lacking in design-build capabilities, which we don't think makes much sense to still be in Metaverse
> 2. virtual buildings once built can persist and become social places in virtual space, subconsciously exerting influence on players.
> 3. Metaverse has a large number of models to be developed in the real-life construction industry and the current mainstream cryptocurrency world, and there is a lot of room for imagination.
> 4. quality construction productivity is "pluggable", similar to "middleware".
>
> Crypto, because of its age group, has been exposed to pixel and voxel styles since childhood, and has a high degree of overlap with Minecraft players, so Minecraft itself has a lot of high-quality content that is naturally suitable to be introduced into the Crypto world.
>
> So in January this year, we were introduced by our friends and delighted to contact the largest Minecraft team in China, Cthuwork, whose work "Qingming Shanghe Tu in Minecraft" has accumulated more than 7 million playbacks on Bilibili. There are also a lot of quality works such as "Forbidden City", "Hot Pot City" and "Thousand Miles of Rivers and Mountains". They bring us more surprises, because their strongest core ability is the ability to cultivate talents, and there are already 250 senior architects in the community, and more growing architects between the ages of 15 and 30. If all these talents can be brought into the Crypto world, we believe we can accelerate the building of Metaverse and bring more quality oriental architecture into Metaverse.
>
> We are very pleased that they saw the value and possibilities of NFT and joined the builders at an early stage.
>
> What we at Metaverse Capital continue to want to do is to find quality content creation teams like Cthuwork to further activate the creative capacity and accelerate the arrival of Metaverse through more advanced forms of incentives.
