As more and more people create, trade, and collect crypto artworks, the way to display these beautiful or eye-catching multimedia NFTs (showing-off is one of the eternal instincts of humans literally) becomes one of users' strong needs. Currently, there are roughly three ways to display and view these NFTs:

- Wallets: Now mainstream wallets such as MetaMask and imToken support displaying and browsing NFT, but the user experience is just so so;
- Marketplaces: [Opensea](https://opensea.io/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and other NFT trading platforms are currently the major ways to browse and display NFTs when you connect your Ethereum wallet. Although Opensea is now the world's largest NFT marketplace, its barren user interface like Taobao seems really not compelling for those high-priced crypto artworks, which can only be used as an industry database;
- Metaverse: These 3D virtual worlds like [Cryptovoxel](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/) are the most vivid way to display crypto art. People can visit and appreciate these NFTs in galleries and exhibition halls that open 24 hours a day, but the threshold for collectors who want to build a gallery is not low‚Äî ‚ÄîYou have to spend money to buy virtual land, build a house and decorate it. Without certain financial resources and professional skills, you will not be able to build it at once.

BingoÔºÅONCYBER is such an NFT display platform that allows you to build a 3D gallery for free with one click.

You can have a magnificent 3D gallery in just 5 steps illustrated in the above graph:

1. You must have an NFT first - if you are an artist, mint one; if you are a collector, buy it!
2. Connect your wallet - there are 4 types of Ethereum wallets that support connections on the right of webpage
3. Select the gallery template provided by ONCYBER, click on your NFT directly to create your gallery happily~~
4. Invite friends to curate and set up the exhibition
5. Share your link and let friends view it üòÑ

This is the gallery of ABMTF_crypto, our project hunter of NFT4Metaverse: https://oncyber.io/abmtf. Not long after ONCYBER went online, ABMTF_crypto tried the product for the first time, communicated closely with the founding team, and put forward many product improvement suggestions, such as supporting the display of NFT with sound dynamic effects.

I have to say that the ONCYBER team has a very good execution. As soon as the above suggestions by ABMTF_crypto are put forward, the team updated their platform within an hour by adding support for multimedia NFT display.

On May 13, ONCYBER announced a new feature: invite curation. If you feel that your own gallery works are not rich enough, you can add the wallet address of the artist or collector friend and invite him to your gallery to hang up his NFTüÜí
