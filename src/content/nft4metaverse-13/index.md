# ENS and YAT, who will become the identity pass of the metaverse? | Thought for Today

> Like the real world, everyone in the future metaverse will need their own identity. So, who will be the passport to walk the Metaverse, ENS (an ethereal domain) or YAT (an emoji domain)?

## ENS: Making Ethernet the Internet Portal for Web 3.0

Ether, which attracts the largest collection of cryptographic protocol assets and users today, has inadvertently solved a major problem that has long plagued the Internet: Single Sign-On (SSO, also translated as "one-click login").

_"Sign-in with ethereum" seems to be becoming the overall solution for accessing every application on the Internet in the future_.

Those who are familiar with using the ethereum platform will find that whether you are logging in to various DApps, trading DeFi or NFT, registering as an artist on NFT platforms like Opensea, Rarible, etc. to exhibit your work, linking to your blog, all you need to do is connect your ethereum wallet (a major wallet app like MetaMask or a browser plugin) and you are good to go. If you sign up for an ENS (username + password), it will not only give you direct access to all the services of the ethereum ecosystem, but will also represent the unique you.

In particular, ENS recently opened the registration of Emoji domain name, which makes your ENS not only a pass, but also a digital business card to show your cute "personality".

### The "single point of failure" of traditional Internet identity login

- The traditional Internet does not have a built-in personal username/authentication system, IP addresses change based on device/location, and DNS (Domain Name System) was never really a personal ID system. Every service needs to know who you are, so each App creates its own username/password system.
- So it was the familiar drama of people re-using weak passwords written on sticky notes; the tedious registration, the need to register every time you use a new app, and the fact that passwords can't be the same and hackers frequent ...... One solution is a password manager, but who uses this stuff?

- Another solution in the last decade is social login. You already have Google, Facebook and other social accounts, so why not just log in to the new service? The user doesn't have to create yet another "username + password" and the new service doesn't have to manage it - win-win?

But here's the question.

- Do users really want Google and Facebook to control "username+password" identity logins across the Internet?
- Do smaller services really want to be at the mercy of these big companies?
- An SSO controlled by a large company can never be "neutral".

Also, people are still using weak passwords when they log in to all services with their Google accounts.

### How is ethereum login, as a new paradigm, neutral?

- First, by providing computer-generated public/private key pairs to ordinary people, with appropriate systems to connect them securely to services, the cryptocurrency incentives finally fulfill the ideals of previous Internet pioneers, cryptopunks.

- Second, an ethereum private key is a secure cipher that you control. No central service is needed to make it work, just sign it with your private key. Your private key is generated on your own device and kept by yourself. However, users need wallets with good user interfaces and experiences to store/use their private keys, and these wallet products like MetaMask, WalletConnect, and the Rainbow Wallet we covered earlier are working on this.

## YAT: Build your own emoji internet portal 🤑

Yat is a decentralized digital identity system built with emojis, and it was named with the following rules

! [](. /yat.png)

From the existing emoji library, mix and match any combination of 3 or more digits and put it after y.at/. If you want to buy 1-2 digits, you need to contact the officials separately.

Yat naming has a scarcity calculation system: RS is mainly determined by the **length** of each Yat. Other factors include the average popularity of the emoji used in the Yat (based on current global usage) and the pattern of the Yat (i.e. repeating emoji or "bookend" emoji). In short, the shorter they are, the more expensive they are, and the hotter the element, the more expensive they are; symmetrical ones are more expensive than asymmetrical ones, and repetitive ones are more expensive than non-repetitive ones.

### Highlights: Emoticons are the most familiar and closest communication elements

Emoticons are the most closely related communication factor to people's lives, one emoji is worth a thousand words 🙄; emojis are the memes closest to people's fingertips, and they are also the ones we can flirt with when we put down the meaning of life for a moment. yat the standard proposed is that you can have these elements here.

Yat is the first project that occupies the emoji narrative and proposes an interesting value framework for it: **Group behavior determines scarcity**. It extends from the domain names of Web 2.0, where the need for everyone to have a portal (domain) on the Internet is still strong. But now y.at serves only to refer to any one Web 2.0 page or collection of pages. Unlike ENS, yat is not yet a portal to Web 3.0, but more of a bridge.

As a result, you're really just going to be able to tell your own story in combinations. Mirror y.at/🔮 🌺 💧 🌕 , y.at/🌕 🍕 🌕 , and our y.at/📺 ⏳ 🕸️ 🌕

I also came up with a 'group selection game to determine scarcity' game: the

- Test subject: YAT
- For example, users who buy three or four emoji as suffixes (say 1000 people in total) combine 3 emoji at random from the existing library of xxx emoji. 1) To see who chooses the most scarce combination, and 2) To determine the scarcity of each emoji based on group behavior
- For example, if Jack chose 🦃️ 🍲 🥑 and no one chose these three, then this one is not scarce. Jessie chose 💩 💊 📺 and the probability of each emoji being chosen is is 12/1000, 25/1000, 799/1000, and the total scarcity is the product.
- The characteristics of this game: instead of a predetermined scarcity, the final decision is made by the group behavior; random walk, the probability of each person picking any emoji is the same, because there is no preference (usually 🚀 🐉 🌕 and so on may be popular, but now it is a group game, the behavior is (more uncertain, but there is no skill in winning, it is pure luck)
- The only possible effects, for example, can be set to computing power differences, such as people who buy more suffixes have multiple chances to choose emoji combinations.

Isn't that a bit like what? This would be an area to look forward to in NFT - a new portal to the internet. could Yat make the start of emoji spreading value on the internet (maybe it already is), could this standard continue, and could Yat perhaps explore more ways to play by building bridges.

This project above is presented by NFT4Metaverse and see you next time!
