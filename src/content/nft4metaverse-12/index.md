On June 17, as the world watched the Shenzhou 12 spacecraft lift off and send three Chinese astronauts to the Tiangong space station, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket to put an upgraded GPS III satellite into orbit in honor of Neil Armstrong, the first human astronaut to walk on the moon.

This time the memorial was done differently. The owners of the launch satellite, the U.S. Space Force, the launch satellite carrier SpaceX, and the meta-universe game project Star Atlas are collaborating for the first time to release an NFT called "Armstrong Forever," a meta-poster with AR (augmented reality) effects.

The first poster for this USSF campaign goes on sale June 15 and closes July 20 (the 52nd anniversary of the first man on the moon) for 69.720 USDC to commemorate Armstrong's moon landing on July 20, 1969.

In the space-themed meta-universe created by Star Atlas, this NFT is more than just a cool AR poster, but features a unique set of in-game bonuses including an exclusive Opal Jet spacecraft with white hot skins, a mining rig with a mining station power plant and an orbital space station with a trading deck. Owning Armstrong Forever NFT also gives you the opportunity to enjoy a variety of in-game benefits such as in-game Neil Armstrong uniform patches, orbital satellite attachments for the spacecraft, and in-game retro space suits. Posters can be cast as resellable NFTs for use throughout the Star Atlas metaverse.

The above NFT props will only work if you join the Star Atlas virtual game meta-universe.

Star Atlas is set in the distant future of 2620, where three factions of humans, aliens, and robots are in a constant struggle for resources, territory, and political domination over each other. Players can become a member of one of these forces to influence the outcome of this interstellar conflict, while being rewarded for their contributions. The name Star Atlas is inspired by the ancient Greek god Atlas, a word meaning atlas, and one of the main goals of Star Atlas is to explore, navigate and discover planets and record data for other explorers.

Star Atlas is a massively multiplayer online game using the Unreal game engine for cinematic visuals, and is also looking to run on the Solana blockchain with a TPS of up to 50,000, blending NFT and DeFi to ultimately build a virtual world of interstellar adventure. The team has rich experience in building 3A games and DeFi, so they have designed a rich "play to earn" gameplay and mechanics.

- **Deep Space Exploration**: Travel anywhere in the open universe of Star Atlas. All visible stars can be manually navigated to or fully recorded in the atlas.
- **Potential Safe Zones**: Safe zones introduce new players to Star Atlas. deep space areas allow for higher pledge matchmaking and higher mining gains.
- **Battle**: All ships, space stations and land facilities are equipped with a variety of weapons and shields for attack and defense.
- **Space Station Modular Construction**: Upgrade space stations and land facilities to unlock higher tiers and features.
- **Crew and Ship Component Outfitting**: Assign the right crew and install the best equipment to improve the ship's score and expand its capabilities.
- **Careers**: Choose the right crew and ship for the ideal career path. Careers vary widely from bounty hunters to data runners and more.
- **Decentralized Autonomous Corporations**: Factions created in the game allow players to collectively compete, consolidate resources, self-govern and manage their own micro-economy.
- **Economic Model**: Players can extract virtual in-game income into real-world income, fully supporting a decentralized, player-driven economy.

Meta-universe games are virtual worlds with embedded free markets and economic models, so tar Atlas has designed two types of tokens and markets.

- ATLAS tokens: Native game tokens for acquiring ships, crew, land and equipment, which are also used primarily as marketplace trading currency.
- POLIS tokens: multifunctional governance tokens that are used in-game and to guide real-world economic policies.
- Universal Marketplace: connects all participants and is the hub for buying and selling all assets. Players can also post lists of paid in-game tasks.

Construction of Star Atlas is just beginning, and the above mechanics design is currently in the blueprint stage. The team announced the launch of the new website on July 23, the release of the browser mini-game on July 24, and the sale of galactic assets. Prior to that, Star Atlas released a total of 14 different content HD posters with the theme "ReBirth", each with an AR experience, music and in-game rewards. Users can purchase the metaverse posters and cast them as NFTs for collection or sale.

This project above is presented by NFT4Metaverse and see you next time!
