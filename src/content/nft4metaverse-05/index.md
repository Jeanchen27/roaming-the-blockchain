> Today, NFT4Metaverse recommends the way to make your static Meebit dance. ✨✨✨✨✨

**By ABMTF_crypto**

Meebits is the 3rd NFT project launched by Larva Labs, the development team of the most popular pixel avatar game Cryptopunks, in early May and it was snapped up as soon as it was launched. According to the introduction, Meebits are ERC-721 compliant 3D voxel characters generated according to a specific algorithm and registered on Ethereum, totaling 20,000, and Cryptopunks and Autoglyphs holders can claim Meebits for free.

_The highest priced Meebit currently sold for 700 ETH_.

At the moment Meebits are still a half-baked product. Next, Meebit owners will have access to a package with a complete 3D model, and will be free to render and animate the Meebit, allowing it to be used in any game engine, 3D studio, or as an avatar in the metaverse. Cryptopunks are collectibles and possibly cultural symbols, but Meebits can be used by developers.

Larva Labs hopes that Meebits will become the future 3D avatars of virtual worlds, games and VR. Today, we show you how to make your Meebits dance, and the process doesn't require complex programming, it's basically a one-click process.

### Step 1: Download the 3D Voxel Model File (T-Pose)

First, you need to unlock the download section by signing with your MetaMask wallet. Then you can proceed and download the T-Pose version .vox file of your Meebit.

### Step 2: Install MagicaVoxel

Download free voxel graphic editor [MagicaVoxel here](https://ephtracy.github.io/). Extract the downloaded package on your drive and run the app.

You will see your Meebit in a preview animation and if there is no fatal glitch you can confirm with 'NEXT' button. Otherwise take a step back and try to realign the markers.

**Note:** The arms and legs may not be bending correctly, depends on your Meebit model.

Once your model is rigged you can choose from countless animations to make your Meebit move. You can download the animated model as FBX or Collada file format and use it in other 3D software or Metaverse.
