The 10,000 CryptoPunks developed and distributed for free by Larva Labs in 2017, the first NFT built on Ether, are now the rarest of digital collectibles: according to DappRadar charts, CryptoPunks rank second in sales transactions at $350 million, behind only the top NFT sales According to the DappRadar rankings, CryptoPunks ranked second with $350 million in sales transactions, behind the NBA Top Shot's $590 million, but the average unit price of CryptoPunks was $25,800, while the NBA Top Shot was only $103.

With such a high price tag for CryptoPunks, can more people own them?PUNKS the Comic has devised an interesting set of gameplay and mechanics.

On May 10, the first issue of PUNKS the Comic was launched at 0.2 ETH and includes the following benefits.

! [](. /comic.jpg)

- First issue of serialized punk comic, ERC-721 standard NFT, casting of 10,000
- Printed comic with free worldwide shipping. Limited print run of 10,000 copies (only those who do not destroy the NFT will receive the print comic, pick up time to be announced)
- 27 similar lucky draws for randomly selected punk NFTs from artists Hackatao, Killer Acid and Robbie Trevino

What happens after you buy the first issue of Punk Comics NFT? Come July, there will be two ways to play.

- Pledge: 50% of the total $PUNKS tokens are shared over 24 months. $PUNKS represents a fragmented ownership of 16 CryptoPunks owned by the project (worth over 600 ETH)

- Destruction: Receive Founders Vault DAO governance tokens with the same maximum number of tokens as the comic NFT, 10,000, i.e. destroy one comic NFT in exchange for one governance token. The holder can DAO the vault (e.g. raise funds to acquire new vault assets), has the right to sell 25% of the $PUNKS tokens and artwork held in the vault (see above for the first installment) or have the entire vault bought out, and can join a private discord group. The value of the vault will continue to grow through subsequent projects by Pixel Vault, the promoter of the punk comic.

It is important to note that only purchases of the first issue of Punk Comics NFTs are eligible to participate in the $PUNKS pledge or destruction of NFTs in exchange for Founders Vault governance tokens; future releases of comics will not have this right.

A total of 100 million $PUNKS tokens are issued by Fractional, an NFT granularity platform, representing the value of 16 CryptoPunks drawn into the comic's story (initial value of 1250 ETH). Holders of $PUNKS tokens can vote on a reserve price to buy out all 16 CryptoPunks. A vote on the reserve price triggers an auction of the entire CryptoPunks vault, while individual CryptoPunks cannot be sold. 75% of the $PUNKS tokens go to the pledge pool and founders' vault DAO, while 25% are reserved for the Pixel Vault team.

The project is so conscientious that it also makes punk comic peripherals, and 100% of the profits from merchandise sales will go directly to the $PUNKS token holders.

Most interestingly, the 16 CryptoPunks are not just sitting in a vault minting NFT subdivision tokens, but are being drawn into comics by the Pixel Vault team. The first punk comic, "The Search for Missing Robbie," features these 16 CryptoPunks as characters, representing a possibility of content-mediated NFT in the meta-universe.

Therefore, the second issue of the punk comic is planned to be created with the recently popular apes as characters, and community users can submit their own apes images as the main characters for the second issue, provided they have the NFT of the first issue of the punk comic to submit, and only one submission per comic is allowed.
