Whether it's crypto artwork that fetches staggeringly high prices, or digital collectibles that the public grabs to open blind boxes, NFT, which has burst out of the ring in this bull market, seems to be used for showing off and collecting without much use for now. Therefore, except for the headline projects such as CryptoPunks and Bored Apes, most of the NFTs cannot escape the embarrassing situation of being sold with great enthusiasm and ending in the cold.

ANON, which launched on June 17, is trying to open up a new path for NFT collectibles: Scrabble and win prizes.

Scrabble is a game that has been popular in Europe and the United States since education became widespread. Many people take a pen and scribble on a newspaper with a crossword puzzle while eating breakfast, drinking afternoon tea or commuting to and from work, in order to win a prize or simply for fun.

Anon NFT calls it Tile, with its representative letters and artwork inspired by various pop culture icons. You can buy, trade and collect Anon Tile on the official website, or play a limited time game released each week to win prizes.

Each Anon NFT will retain its value based on its rarity level and its use in the game. No matter what Tile you receive, there will always be other players in the community who need that letter, creating a win-win situation for everyone. Community users can play the game, collect Tiles, or buy Tiles on the secondary market if they think demand will increase when a new crossword is released.

If you're lucky enough, you may get the only limited edition Anon Tile, which is entitled to 1% of the primary sales. Scrabble winners will not only receive rare NFT collectibles like CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, Punk Comics or rare physical collectibles for everyone, but will also earn a spot on the leaderboard for a chance to win special perks and rewards.

### How do you play the game?

The rules of the game are simple.

- Scrabble will be posted in the "Games" section of the website
- Get the Tile with the correct letter to solve the puzzle (if you don't have it, you can go to the "Marketplace" and buy the required Tile).
- Place your letters in the correct order
- Click Submit before the end of the game
- Once all submissions are received, the winner will be chosen at random from all correct answers in the chain
- One successful submission will be allowed per address
- To claim the prize, you must have the Tile that successfully solved the puzzle

- The only limited edition Anon Tile is considered a wildcard that can represent any letter of the alphabet
