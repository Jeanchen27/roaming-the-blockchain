# RAINBOW WALLET：the Most Beautiful Ethereum Wallet to Showcase NFTs | Today's Pick

> Today, NFT4Metaverse recommends the most beautiful Ethereum wallet: [RAINBOW WALLET](https://www.rainbow.me/) ✨✨✨✨✨

**By ABMTF_crypto**

**Wallet** is the most important way to collect and display NFTs, but most wallets currently lack support for NFTs. Therefore, when NFT4Meataverse discovered RAINBOW WALLET, the most friendly Ethereum wallet with NFT support and the most beautiful UI by far, our excitement can be imagined!

Now, we will use Vitalik’s public wallet address to take you a complete journey of the beautiful 🌈👛 ✌️

There are a lot of NFTs in Vitalik's Wallet. After a rough count, there are a total of 41 kinds of 92 NFTs, some of which are collectibles of well-known projects such as CryptoKitties, Axie Infinity, and Enji.

We selected several NFTs and made a Showcase selection for Vitalik 😄

Rainbow Wallet's display of NFT is very lively and beautiful, and it can also display multimedia NFT, which other wallets have not been able to do so far.

The team announced on Twitter yesterday that the web profile and search functions will be launched this week. The above picture is a bunch of NFTs displayed by searching Vitalik's address. We speculate that Rainbow Wallet will strengthen the social function based on NFT, which may be compete with [SHOWTIME](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/n9jtLs7iaxpQOC1e7zLcHQ) we recommended before.
