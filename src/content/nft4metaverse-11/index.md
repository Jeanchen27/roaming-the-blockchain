This NFT is a digital collectible, a ticket to the conference (with continuous access to VeeCon 2022, 2023, and 2024), and a membership entitlement that allows for one-on-one networking with Gary Vaynerchuk online, and offline dining and sports.

Obviously, this is the recent rise of Social Token. But unlike the ERC 20 smart contract, all 268 characters of VeeFriends are drawn by Gary Vaynerchuk himself, with a lot of sincerity.

Gary Vaynerchuk says that VeeCon is inspired by various favorite business conferences, music festivals, summer camps he has attended, etc. VeeCon is probably the big party he has wanted to throw for years, hoping to bring great shared networking and social value to all the coin holders who attend.

Who is Gary Vaynerchuk, the man who released such a successful social NFT?

Serial entrepreneur and current Chairman of VaynerX and CEO of VaynerMedia, Gary Vaynerchuk, 45, immigrated to New York City from Belarus with his family in 1978, started selling lemonade at age 7, sold tens of thousands of dollars in baseball cards and toys while in high school, and helped his family with their ice bag business at age 14.

Gary was particularly sensitive to new things and transformed his father's local liquor store into one of the first wine e-commerce platforms when the Internet bubble started in the 1990s, exploding from $3 million to $60 million and renaming the business Wine Library. Gary began filming and broadcasting a YouTube video called WineLibraryTV almost daily for five years. Through this, Gary became a best-selling author on marketing communications and founded VaynerMedia, a digital advertising agency that provides full service to Fortune 500 companies such as PepsiCo, GE, Johnson & Johnson, and Chase.

In addition to running multiple businesses, Gary chronicles his daily life as CEO in real time through social media, gaining over 30 million followers on all platforms. His podcast, The GaryVee Audio Experience, ranks among the top podcasts in the world, and Gary is a five-time New York Times bestselling author and one of the most sought-after public speakers.

Now often referred to as GaryVee, Gary identifies trends and patterns early and keenly, and helps others understand how these changes are affecting marketing and consumer behavior. Whether it's emerging artists, eSports, NFT investments or digital communications, Gary understands how to bring brand relevance to the forefront. And, he is an active angel investor, having invested in Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase and Uber in his early years.

So, such a big shot to test the waters of publishing social NFT is really powerful ......
