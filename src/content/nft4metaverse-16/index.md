The Metaverse is coming to you through gaming, social, collaboration, entertainment, and even crypto art and virtual assets.

There is no doubt that it will not be presented to you as a single application, platform and world, but rather there are thousands of applications that will attract your immersion.

Creating a 3D avatar just for you and exploring endless virtual worlds with a unified identity is inevitable.

Ready Player Me, your passport to the metaverse.

## Who created Ready Player Me?

As you can see from the video above, uploading a photo or a simple selfie will create a lifelike 3D avatar, and you can choose to edit the avatar's skin tone, hair style and dress.

The technology behind the easy and simple functionality is not simple. Wolf3D, the company that created the Ready Player Me platform, is an AI company founded in 2014. Their first product was a professional-grade 3D scanner that scanned over 20,000 people in public places like airports, museums, and halls, collecting a large database of high-quality facial scans that allowed Wolf3D to build deep learning models that could generate the perfect virtual avatar from any selfie taken with any device. Over the years, Wolf3D has worked with companies such as Tencent, Huawei, HTC, Vodafone and H&M to create best-in-class 3D avatar systems for their users.

## More than 200 developers adopted Ready Player Me avatar

A year ago, Wolf3D released the Ready Player Me platform, which not only allows ordinary users to create 3D avatars that can pass through many virtual worlds in a few simple steps, but also provides developers with free and easy-to-use tools to integrate Ready Player Me into their apps and games without having to develop their own 3D avatar system. As seen on the **readyplayer.me/developers** page, Ready Player Me supports Web, iOS, Android apps and the two major game engines, Unreal and Unity.
